# My First BI Dashboard

Welcome to my first Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard project! This project showcases a dashboard created with Tableau Public using synthetic data.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Tableau Public dashboard and a Colab notebook used for data processing and analysis. The dashboard is designed to demonstrate key insights and visualizations from the synthetic data.
